# Mini Cooper Virtual Cockpit Project

## Overview

The Mini Cooper Virtual Cockpit Project is a digital dashboard interface designed to enhance the driving experience of a Mini Cooper by providing real-time vehicle data and three distinct GUI screens: ECO, Normal, and Sport+. This project utilizes a combination of Adobe Illustrator for design, a Python backend with PySide for Qt design, and OBD2 Python for real-time data streaming from the Mini Cooper. The GUI is implemented using QML, and the communication between the Python backend and the GUI is achieved through the Qt signals and slots mechanism. The project was developed using the Qt Creator integrated development environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Design: Adobe Illustrator**
  - Adobe Illustrator was used to create the graphical assets and designs for the Mini Cooper Virtual Cockpit.

- **Backend: Python with PySide and OBD2 Python**
  - Python, in conjunction with the PySide framework, was employed to develop the backend of the virtual cockpit, handling the communication between the GUI and the OBD2 interface for real-time vehicle data streaming.

- **GUI Design: QML**
  - The graphical user interface (GUI) of the virtual cockpit is created using QML, allowing for the seamless integration of design elements into the interface.

- **Communication: Qt Signals and Slots**
  - Qt's signals and slots mechanism is used to establish communication between the Python backend and the GUI, enabling data exchange and interaction between the two components.

- **IDE: Qt Creator**
  - Qt Creator was the chosen integrated development environment for the project, facilitating the design and development of the virtual cockpit.

## GUI Screens
